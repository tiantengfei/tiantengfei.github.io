The following is setting up for my os.

### default python to python3
#### 1. if python3 has be installed by Homebrew, turn to 3. 
Otherwise:
```
brew update
brew install python
```
#### 2. check the location python3 has been installed
```
brew info python
```
the info is:

```
Caveats
Python has been installed as
  /usr/local/bin/python3

Unversioned symlinks python, python-config, pip etc. pointing to
python3, python3-config, pip3 etc., respectively, have been installed into
  /usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin
```

#### 3. edit PATH:
```
export PATH=/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH
```
Note: /usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin must be before $PATH, which will reference to
python3 when excuting the command python.

### python site-packages path
* python -c "import site; print(site.getsitepackages())"
